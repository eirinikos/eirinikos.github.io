KCRW is continuing tonight's tribute with the entirety of the *Ziggy Stardust* album. I was just listening to the live concert album yesterday - when the in-studio version ofÂ *Moonage Daydream* came up in Justin's shuffle, it reminded me how much I love the live version. I often listen to it several times in a row, and I did so again yesterday. Goodbye, David Bowie.
