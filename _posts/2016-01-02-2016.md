Today was a good day - resisted the urge to sleep in, had my first coffee in a week, and enjoyed it with the Murakami novel I'm currently reading. Wrote some cards to be mailed to the folks back in Canada, called my mom, jogged 3 miles at the gym, later went to Ralph's, and spent most of the rest of the day and evening unpacking, laundering, and doing a vigorous New Year's apartment clean-out (still not complete). My knees appear to be paying for it, and I appear to be at an age to say things like, "My knees appear to be paying for it."

Capped the day with an IPA, [Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee](http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com), and a stab at [this Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=47).
