I feel like this weekend has been an ongoing toast to life - if that doesn't sound too trite. It started with a solid cup of caffeine (the socially acceptable way to toast life in the waking hours) and continued with an all-day [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/la) Saturday workshop. It was easily the most enjoyable tech event I've participated in thus far - brimming over with joy and positivity - and learning, and building, and encouragement, and optimism! And heart!

In the days and hours leading up to the workshop, I was nervous about the [5-minute talk](https://speakerdeck.com/eirinikos) I was planning to give, along with how well I would connect with my students and the other workshop participants. I love Ruby to death but I was worried that too much time had passed since my life was immersed in Rails. And I'm an [ambivert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Ambiversion), with most of my childhood and early adulthood having been steeped in shyness. Was I going to be a good coach?

In the end, I found that "Get excited and make things!" really does fit the Rails Girls credo. I often have a hard time heading to an event solo, when the handful of people I may recognize by sight or name is eclipsed by the vast majority of people I don't know at all. But today's Rails Girls workshop seemed too significant an event to pass up. Volunteering to give a short [non-technical] talk was a to-the-point way to insert myself into a social context that otherwise might've felt intimidating. I struck up or joined so many more conversations than I expected to, several of which I intend to continue.

Ironically, the immediate aftermath of the workshop involved stepping back into the world of awful, awful Hollywood Blvd. At 9:00 on a Saturday morning, Hollywood is serene, quiet, cleanly empty of its usual chaos. Stepping back onto the curb at 6:20 p.m. meant re-entering an insane hall of mirrors. Yes, that's the curmudgeon in me speaking.

I phoned Justin and found that he was picking up groceries at 3rd and La Brea on his way home from the Westside. The idea of a leisurely walk down Highland to meet him seemed more appealing than the idea of sitting in a dank underground metro station. So I walked 45 minutes southward to 3rd Street to digest all that had happened in one day. An interesting 2.5-mile walk - that began amidst a beehive of tourist activity, that then passed through a somewhat desolate stretch where sidewalk feces is not surprising, then a length of blocks strung with expensive homes, then a Hasidic community.

ANYWAY - this evening I have volunteer duty at another women's celebration ([GDI LA's 2nd birthday party](https://twitter.com/girlDevelopItLA/status/710955110097100806)) - this time on the 37th floor of a massive building in Downtown, a 20-minute walk from home. As a treat to myself, I bought a giant bag of soil to invest in some new plantings this week.

Spring is officially here!
