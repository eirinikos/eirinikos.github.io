This afternoon, I read about URLs in <ins><a href="https://launchschool.com/books/http">Introduction to HTTP</a></ins>. Again, many thanks to Launch School for making this book available via their Open Book Shelf. My notes are directly attributable to the content from their book.

A URL comprises 3 main components:

- **http**: this is the **URL scheme**; it tells the web client how to access the resource. "http" tells the web client to use HTTP to make a request; other common URL schemes are **ftp**, **mailto** or **git**.
- **cherimoya.com**: this is the resource path or **host**; it tells the client where the resource is hosted or located.
- **/home/**: this is the URL path; it shows what local resource is being requested.

URLs can also include a port number which the host uses to listen to HTTP requests. The default port number for HTTP is port **80**. Even though this port number isn't always specified, it's assumed to be part of every URL. **Unless a different port number is specified, port 80 is used by default in normal HTTP requests.**

A URL might also include a query string or parameter, which usually contains some form of data to be sent to the server. In the following URL...

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span class="green">http://avocadoshop.com?variety=hass&size=tiny&status=ripe</span></p>

... name/value pairs in the form of **variety=hass**, **size=tiny**, and **status=ripe** are passed to the server from the URL. This request asks the **avocadoshop.com** server to locate a record with the given parameter values.

By default, URLs accept only certain characters in the ASCII character set. URL encoding replaces non-conforming characters with a % symbol followed by two hexadecimal digits that represent the ASCII code of the character, e.g.:

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span class="green">http://pomegranate-world.org/pomegranate%20trees.html</span></p>
**N.B. <span class="blue">&</span> (ampersand) is reserved for use as a query string delimiter. <span class="blue">:</span> (colon) is also reserved to delimit host/port components and user/password.**
