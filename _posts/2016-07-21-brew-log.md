![brew log]({{site.github.url}}/images/2016-07/brew-journal-05.jpg)

<span class="caption"><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=brew+log">Google "brew log"</a> and you'll find <i>many</i> ways to log your homebrewing adventures, such as <a href="http://www.direktconcept.com/2014/06/11/log-every-brew-note-can-think-brew-journal/">this page</a>, from which the photo is taken.</span>

Picking up where I left off (*way* back [in this post]({% post_url 2016-06-27-its-hot %}))... here's a discussion of the test coverage I added for <span style="background-color:#ffdb4d"><strong><code>brew log</code></strong></span>.

Like **`brew home`**, **`brew log`** can be run with or without arguments. When run without any arguments, **`brew log`** is akin to running **`git log`** on the Homebrew repository, i.e., it returns the [commit history](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History) of the entire Git repository. When run with an argument in the form of a formula's name, e.g., **`brew log ack`**, it returns the commit history for that formula.

My pull request for **`brew log`** proved more challenging than [its 33 lines of code](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/cmd/log.rb) and existing 75% test coverage lead me to believe.

{% highlight ruby %}
def test_log
  FileUtils.cd HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY do
    shutup do
      system "git", "init"
      system "git", "commit", "--allow-empty", "-m", "This is a test commit"
    end
  end
  assert_match "This is a test commit", cmd("log")
ensure
  (HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY/".git").rmtree
end
{% endhighlight %}

As shown above, the previously existing test does all these things:


- changes directory ([**`FileUtils.cd`**](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.8.7/libdoc/fileutils/rdoc/FileUtils.html#method-c-cd)) into the directory containing the Homebrew Git repository.
  - (from within this directory) calls **`shutup`** (defined in [**`Homebrew/test/testing_env.rb`**](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/test/testing_env.rb)) to *shut up* or suppress output from the commands that are enclosed between **`do`** and **`end`**:
	  - calls [**`system`**](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.8.7/Kernel.html#method-i-system) **`"git","init"`**, which runs **`git init`** in a subshell:
        - **`git init`** initializes an empty Git repo by creating a **`/.git`** directory with various subdirectories and files.
	  - calls **`system "git","commit"`**, which runs **`git commit`** in a subshell:
        - **`git commit`** records a commit that includes no new changes from its parent commit (which is allowed when **`--allow-empty`** is passed), and uses the commit message, **`"This is a test commit"`**.

- makes the assertion (with [**`assert_match`**](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/minitest/rdoc/MiniTest/Assertions.html#method-i-assert_match)) that the recorded commit message is output when **`brew log`** is run.

- ensures (with **`ensure`**) the removal of the **`/.git`** directory at the end of the test.


In my [pull request](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/333), I aimed to add coverage for the behavior that **`brew log`** exhibits when it's called on a formula file or a shallow clone. My pull request broke a few things (oops) that were soon rectified by Martin's [follow-up PR](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/350) (yay).

Here's the incarnation of **`test_log_formula`** that emerged (and was soon updated again with the [refactoring of the integration tests file](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/370)):

{% highlight ruby %}
  def test_log_formula
    core_tap = CoreTap.new
    formula_file = core_tap.formula_dir/"testball.rb"
    formula_file.write <<-EOS.undent
      class Testball < Formula
        url "https://example.com/testball-0.1.tar.gz"
      end
    EOS

    core_tap.path.cd do
      shutup do
        system "git", "init"
        system "git", "add", "--all"
        system "git", "commit", "-m", "This is a test commit for Testball"
      end
    end

    core_tap_url = "file://#{core_tap.path}"
    shallow_tap = Tap.fetch("homebrew", "shallow")
    shutup do
      system "git", "clone", "--depth=1", core_tap_url, shallow_tap.path
    end

    assert_match "This is a test commit for Testball",
                 cmd("log", "#{shallow_tap}/testball")
    assert_predicate shallow_tap.path/".git/shallow", :exist?,
                     "A shallow clone should have been created."
  ensure
    formula_file.unlink
    (core_tap.path/".git").rmtree
    shallow_tap.path.rmtree
  end
 {% endhighlight %}


**`test_log_formula`** does these things:

- creates a **`testball.rb`** formula file in the **`Homebrew/homebrew-core`** tap.

- changes directory ([**`core_tap.path.cd`**](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/extend/pathname.rb)) into the directory containing the **`Homebrew/homebrew-core`** tap, which is **`/usr/local/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core`**.
  - (from within this directory) calls **`shutup`** and:
    - initializes an empty Git repo;
    - [adds all new or modified files to the index](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add), which holds a snapshot of the repo's current content; and
    - records a commit and commit message.

- creates a **`core_tap_url`** variable and sets it equal to a string containing the [file URI-formatted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme) path to the **`Homebrew/homebrew-core`** tap.


- creates a **`shallow_tap`** variable and sets it equal to a newly [instantiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)) **`Tap`** (named **`Homebrew/homebrew-shallow`**).

- calls **`shutup`** and:
  - makes a shallow Git clone (**`--depth=1`**) of the **`Homebrew/homebrew-core`** repo into the location where **`Homebrew/homebrew-shallow`** resides.

- makes a couple of assertions.

- ensures that all newly created files and directories are removed at the end of the test.

There you have it!
