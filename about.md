I'm a Los Angeles homeowner, map enthusiast, plant lover, pianist, and audiophile.

Ruby is my native programming language. I'm learning Javascript with a mixture of optimism and trepidation. Biweekly pair-programming nights in Little Tokyo are helping with the pain.

Open educational resources, open-source mapping, and open-anything that lets us better understand the world we live in - these are among the things that inspired me to wonder what I could contribute during my time on earth. 

I also love studying human languages and reading about linguistics. Every now and then I dip into [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com) or [Babbel](http://babbel.com) to play with languages familiar and unfamiliar, or I try to compose nonsensical sentences in 廣東話 (in the offline world).
