- [LA Region Library Map](https://github.com/rhubarb-crew/la-region-library-map)

>##### A collaboration with fellow [Maptimers](https://github.com/maptimeLA/), Nina Kin and Kenny Lee.

Since completing Bloc’s program, I’ve developed several ideas for library mapping projects that have garnered interested collaborators among members of Maptime LA (a local community group).

My first project will map all public library locations in L.A. County, placing calls to the Google Maps API and government open data APIs (if available). This includes the City of L.A. and County of L.A. library systems, as well as all other city library systems within L.A. County (e.g., libraries in Pasadena and Santa Monica). The map will display info windows for each branch location, allowing the user to see branch names, addresses, hours, and web URLs.
