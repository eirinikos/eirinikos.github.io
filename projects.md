###[LA Region Library Map](https://github.com/rhubarb-crew/la-region-library-map)

>##### A collaboration with fellow [Maptimers](https://github.com/maptimeLA/), Nina Kin and Kenny Lee.

My first library mapping project will map all public library locations in L.A. County, placing calls to the Google Maps API and government open data APIs (if available). This includes the City of L.A. and County of L.A. library systems, as well as all other city library systems within L.A. County (e.g., libraries in Pasadena and Santa Monica). The map will display an info window for each branch location, allowing the user to see branch names, addresses, hours, and URLs. Eventually, Iâ€™d like to implement the mapping with Leaflet or Mapbox (both of which are open-source) instead of Google Maps.

###[Tic Tac Toe!](https://github.com/eirinikos/ruby-bites#tictactoerb)

>##### A command-line tic-tac-toe game dispenser 

It's written entirely in Ruby, so yes, it was fun not only to write and refactor the code, but also to debug it. I still need to implement testing. Play against another human or play against an arrogant computer adversary; play on a conventional 3 x 3 board or play on a 4 x 4 board.

###[Open Todo API](https://github.com/eirinikos/open-todo-api)

>##### An API for a to-do list client-side application.

This was the last of the four Bloc applications I made with Matt. It returns JSON representations of users, lists, and items. It relies on Rails serializers to convert Rails objects into JSON.

###[Blocmetrics](https://kao-blocmetrics.herokuapp.com)

>##### A analytics service API.

This project acquainted me with how a web analytics works, among other things. With the client-side JS snippet, a user tracks events on their website. The server-side API captures and save those events to a database, and the captured event data is displayed back to the user in the form of pretty pie and line charts. 

###[Bloccitoff](https://kao-bloccitoff.herokuapp.com)

>##### A self-destructing to-do list application.

This classic to-do list project has an added twist - it automatically destroys items that aren't yet done after 7 days.

###[Bloccit](https://kao-bloccit.herokuapp.com)

>##### A replica of Reddit.

This was my first project with my Bloc mentor, Matthieu Tanguay-Carel.
